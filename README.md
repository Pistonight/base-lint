# base-lint
Very basic linter for my projects. My projects should all look the same no?

**Project is not being maintained anymore. I use prettier/rustfmt instead now**

## Usage
Include iTNTPiston/base-lint as submodule and just call it like `python path/to/base-lint`

## Dev
`pip install pycodestyle`
`pycodestyle .`
`python . . -c`
